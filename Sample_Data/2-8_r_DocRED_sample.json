We have a diverse body of players , staff and support teams , so the challenges and areas of concern will vary . \n As the governing body , our focus is making sure that players feel they can come forward and share their concerns , which plays a critical role in being able to address the issues that may be at hand ,\u201d entity1 WTA entity1 Chairman and CEO entity7 Steve Simon entity7 said in an email to entity6 The Associated Press entity6 . \n Might be hard to gauge the success of such an initiative so soon , but entity8 Simon entity8 found at least one positive measure . \n \u201c We are seeing more athletes coming forward ,\u201d he said , \u201c which is a great initial result .\u201d Adding what entity8 Simon entity8 called \u201c the expertise of a dedicated safeguarding position \u201d is the biggest public - facing step taken by the Florida - based WTA in this area since the issue of protecting players drew increased attention last year : A French player once ranked as high as No . \n 39 accused her former coach of rape ; another player sued the U . S . Tennis Association for failing to protect her from a coach she says sexually abused her at one of its training centers when she was 19 ; 2002 International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee Pam Shriver , who won 21 Grand Slam titles in women \u2019 s doubles , said she \u201c had an inappropriate and damaging relationship with my much older coach \u201d that began when she was 17 and he was 50 . \n \u201c Maybe we need to talk more to players and tell them what \u2019 s going on with everything so they know to be careful ,\u201d said two - time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur , a 28 - year - old from Tunisia . \n \u201c Maybe it \u2019 s never enough and we should do more .\u201d \n\nRelations in the predefined set of relations in the above text:?\n"
