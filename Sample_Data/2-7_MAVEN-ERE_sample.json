        "instructions": "Your task is relation extraction between two events/\"Timex\" in a given document. An event is a specific occurrence of something. A \"Timex\" is a specific time point.\n\nThere are 10 types of relations: [\"before\", \"overlap\", \"contains\", \"simultaneous\", \"begins-on\", \"ends-on\", \"cause\", \"precondition\", \"subevent\", and \"coreference\"].\n(1) A, before, B: A is earlier than B.\n(2) A, overlap, B: the time range of A overlaps with the time range of B.\n(3) A, contains, B: the time range of A contains the time range of B.\n(4) A, simultaneous, B: the time range of A is the same as the time range of B.\n(5) A, begins-on, B: A begins at the time of B.\n(6) A, ends-on, B: A terminates at the time of B.\n(7) A, cause, B: A causes B.\n(8) A, precondition, B: A is a necessary condition of B. But A itself, without other conditions, might not cause B.\n(9) A, subevent, B: B is a component part of A and is spatiotemporally contained by A.\n(10) A, coreference, B: A and B refer to the same event.\nThe first 6 relation types ([\"before\", \"overlap\", \"contains\", \"simultaneous\", \"begins-on\", \"ends-on\"]) can be between two events, event and \"Timex\", or two \"Timex\". The later 4 relation types ([\"cause\", \"precondition\", \"subevent\", and \"coreference\"]) can only be between two events.\n\nThen, I will give you some documents. In each document, I annotate 2 events/\"Timex\" as \"<Event> event_name </Event>\" or \"<Timex> Timex_name </Timex>\".\nPlease judge whether there is a specific type of relation from the first event/\"Timex\" to the second event/\"Timex\". Only consider the relation from the first event/\"Timex\" to the second event/\"Timex\", but don't consider the relation from the second event/\"Timex\" to the first one. First explain your thoughts and then give the answer. If there is no relation, which is of a very high possibility, the answer should be \"Answer: []\". If there is a relation type or multiple relation types, the answer form is \"Answer: [relation type 1, relation type 2, ...]\".\nDon't consider any extra knowledge outside the given document. Don't make any complex inferences and only consider direct relations. Don't extend the meaning of an event/\"Timex\" to its surrounding words, but only consider the meaning of the specific words.\n",

Once consolidated, it could be used as a jumping-off point for an advance by the 24th Armoured Brigade. From the 2nd Rifle Brigade <Event> defeated </Event> numerous Axis armoured counter-attacks and withstood constant artillery-bombardments and machine-gun fire, while knocking out armoured vehicles, with intermittent support from the tanks and artillery of the 1st Armoured Division. The defence of Outpost Snipe managed to spoil the biggest Axis counter-attack against the positions captured by the Eighth Army, during Operation Lightfoot but the Battalion had 72 casualties. The fighting at Outpost Snipe led Rommel to write that an armoured attack, on ground which the defenders had been able to prepare, was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe first event/\"Timex\": <Event> defeated </Event>\nThe second event/\"Timex\": <Event> ordered </Event>\n"
