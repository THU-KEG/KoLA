S . Soccer Federation said Berhalter would remain a candidate to return as coach .His contract expired Dec . 31 .\u201c Given the investigators \u2019 conclusion that there is no legal impediment to employing him , Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to serve as head coach ,\u201d the USSF said in a statement .The governing body said it will not hire a coach until it appoints a new sporting director , a position that oversees all national teams ."

C . United remains an evolving enterprise under Coach Wayne Rooney , still missing pieces and still finding its way through the early stage of the MLS season .At the least , United plays hard for the former English superstar , whose fierce determination as a player in Washington a few years ago won over skeptical fans .On Saturday , for the second time in two appearances at Audi Field this season , United \u2019 s resolve produced another stirring finish \u2014 albeit this time one that yielded only one point .Midfielder Chris Durkin scored a wonderful goal in the 80th minute , ending a night of frustration for goal - averse United in a 1 - 1 draw with Orlando City .Opportunities were aplenty for United ( 1 - 1 - 1 ), but it took Durkin \u2019 s strike to offset rookie Duncan McGuire \u2019 s goal early in the second half .\u201c I wanted to see a reaction [ to Orlando \u2019 s goal ], which I did , so 90 percent of the game I thought was good .The 10 percent , it wasn \u2019 t ,\u201d Rooney said .\u201c We need to make sure when we go into them [ low ] periods , we \u2019 re harder to beat or harder to score against .\u201d He added , \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of positives we can take from it \u2014 just frustrating we didn \u2019 t take three points .\u201d At the top of the box , Durkin cut the ball back on C\u00e9sar Ara\u00fajo , then ripped a 16 - yard , left - footed shot with terrific technique and execution .The ball took flight and beat goalkeeper Pedro Gallese to the far side for Durkin \u2019 s third career MLS goal ."
