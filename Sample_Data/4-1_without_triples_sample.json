Batts reported that , contrary to department policy , the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station ; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray 's arrest , following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city , and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years .The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport .The medical examiner 's office concluded that Gray 's death could not be ruled an accident , and was instead a homicide , because officers failed to follow safety procedures `` through acts of omission .
